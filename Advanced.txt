Exercises
• Given the data below, define a type alias for representing users.
let users = [
{
name: 'John Smith',
age: 30,
occupation: 'Software engineer'
},
{
name: 'Kate Müller',
age: 28
}
];
=> type User={
    name: string,
    age: number,
    occupation?: string
}



• Birds fly. Fish swim. A Pet can be a Bird or Fish. Use type aliases to represent these
=>
type bird={
    fly:()=>void;
};
type fish={
    swim:()=>void;
};

type Pet: bird || fish;

• Define a type for representing the days of week. Valid values are “Monday”, “Tuesday”,
etc.
=>
type dayOfWeek={
    day: 'monday'|....|'Friday';
}


• Simplify the following code snippets:
let user = getUser();
console.log(user && user.address ? user.address.street : undefined);
=>console.log(user?.address?.street)


let x = foo !== null && foo !== undefined ? foo : bar();

=>let x= foo?? bar();


• What is the problem in this piece of code?
let value: unknown = 'a';
console.log(value.toUpperCase());
=> value of a is unknown. So type narrowing needs to be done for the code to be executed.
